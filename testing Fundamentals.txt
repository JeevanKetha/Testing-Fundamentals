Q1: Which of the given testing levels is focused primarily on building confidence rather than finding defects?
Answer: Acceptance Testing

Explanation: Acceptance testing is typically conducted to build confidence in the system's ability to meet the business and user requirements, ensuring it is ready for release.

Q2: Which of the given statements is most suitable for assessing the scope of maintenance testing?
Answer: Scope is linked to the risk, size of the system under test, and extent of the changes done.

Explanation: Maintenance testing often depends on risk assessment, system size, and the changes made, as these factors influence the depth and breadth of testing required.

Q3: Which test principle does the scenario describe?
Answer: Defect clustering.

Explanation: The principle of defect clustering suggests that most defects are concentrated in a few areas, leading the test lead to prioritize testing specific screens.

Q4: Which characteristics should a tester possess to successfully work with a project team?
Answer: Efficient communication skills and good observation skills.

Explanation: Effective communication is critical for collaborating with team members, and observation skills are necessary to identify subtle defects and inconsistencies.

Q5: Select the correct order for test case design activities.
Answer: C-A-D-B

Explanation: Analyze requirements (C), identify test design techniques (A), specify expected results (D), and determine execution order (B).

Q6: What type of non-functional testing ensures software is easy to analyze and modify?
Answer: Maintainability.

Explanation: Maintainability testing evaluates how easy it is to maintain, enhance, or correct the software.

Q7: Which scenario requires maintenance testing?
Answer: A component of an existing software application is removed.

Explanation: Maintenance testing is triggered by changes, such as modifications, deletions, or updates to software components.

Q8: Which statements about maintenance testing are true?
Answer: (i) & (iii).

Explanation: Maintenance testing involves regression testing, re-testing, and impact analysis to address scope-related challenges.

Q9: Which level of testing aligns with the stated exit criterion?
Answer: System testing.

Explanation: System testing validates the complete system against defined requirements, often requiring resolution of critical defects before exit.

Q10: What does 90% statement coverage mean?
Answer: Nine out of ten statements were exercised by this set of tests.

Explanation: Statement coverage measures the proportion of code statements executed by the test cases.

Q11: Features of good testing in SDLC models include:
Answer: Testers should be associated with document reviews early, and each test level should have specific objectives.

Explanation: Early involvement and clear objectives improve test effectiveness and align testing with project goals.

Q12: Which testing technique identifies missed test cases?
Answer: Experience-based.

Explanation: Experience-based techniques rely on intuition and expertise to uncover gaps in formal testing.

Q13: Which tasks are considered as part of a tester's role?
Answer: Prepare and collect test data, implement and execute tests, and create test design specifications.

Explanation: These tasks align with a testerâ€™s responsibilities throughout the testing process.

Q14: An important feature of regression testing test cases is:
Answer: They can be reused for multiple releases with very little maintenance.

Explanation: Well-designed regression test cases are adaptable and efficient across software iterations.

Q15: Valid objectives of testing include:
Answer: To find defects, to gain confidence in the quality level, and to prevent defects.

Explanation: Testing aims to uncover defects, ensure quality, and prevent issues through early detection and corrective actions.
